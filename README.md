# Image Search Engine
Creating an Image Search Engine application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an exciting project. HTML forms the structure, CSS provides styling, and JavaScript adds functionality. The user interface comprises an input field for search queries and a display area for images. JavaScript fetches data from an API like Google Custom Search or Unsplash, handling user requests dynamically. CSS ensures a visually appealing layout, with responsive design for various devices. Pagination can enhance user experience, allowing seamless navigation through results. With proper coding practices and attention to detail, this project offers a valuable learning experience in web development, combining creativity and technical skills.
